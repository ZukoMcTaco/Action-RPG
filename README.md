# Action-RPG
Mini Godot project I created.

This is powered by the Godot game engine, which uses GDScript for the backend.


The game isn't fully finished as I only created this mainly to experiment with Godot and had only created 1 level.


All the sprites, sound effects are all open-source and the purpose of this game was for me to gain more insight on game development as I had gained interest in developing an RPG from playing games :)
